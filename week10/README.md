## Live Session

### Outlier Detection
- Outlier: a data object that deviates significantly from the normal objects as it is an error. Not noise.
- Global Outlier
  - Significantly deviates from the rest of the data set
- Contextual outlier
  - deviates significantly based on the selected context
- Collective Outlier
  - a subset of data objects collectively deviated significantly from the whole data set, even if the individual data objects may not be outliers.
  
#### Challenges of outlier detection
- modeling normal objects and outliers properly
- application-specific outlier detection
- handling noise in outlier detection
- understandability
